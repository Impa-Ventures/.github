# Build. Back. Belong.

At **Impa Ventures**, we believe that venture capital should be written in code —  
not just capital allocation, but product creation.

We’re a **venture studio and early-stage fund** backing founders in **AI and Crypto**,  
while building alongside them — from first commit to first customer.

### Our Philosophy

- **Builders backing builders.**  
  Every investment is a collaboration, every prototype a shared repo.  
  We don’t just fund ideas; we fork them, refactor them, and deploy them together.

- **Conviction → Code.**  
  Insight matters only when it ships.  
  We turn research, conviction, and curiosity into code, infrastructure, and open experiments.

- **Open ecosystem.**  
  From DAOs to decentralized infra, from agents to analytics —  
  we build in the open, learn in public, and contribute back to the builder community.

### What We Build

- 🧠 **AI Infrastructure** – developer tools, inference systems, agents, and creation platforms.  
- 🌐 **Crypto Infrastructure** – decentralized hosting, networks, and protocols for builders.  
- ⚙️ **Internal Experiments** – product prototypes born from curiosity and conviction.  

Explore our open projects, join our experiments, or fork an idea —  
because **the best way to invest in the future is to build it.**
